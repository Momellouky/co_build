# CO-BUILD : Collaborative Virtual Environment Project


## Introduction
This Unity 3D project serves as a continuation of the practical sessions, focusing on creating a Collaborative Virtual Environment. The project builds upon previous sessions and aims to enhance collaboration among users in a shared virtual universe.

## Minimal Features 
- Multiple users can join the same virtual universe.
- Synchronized virtual universe views (WYSIWIS).
- Users are visible through avatars and identifiable.
- Users interact using visible tools.
- Basic collaborative work implemented.

## Additional Features
- Users can choose their entry point in the shared universe.
- Notifications for users joining or leaving the virtual environment.
- List of connected users.
- Communication tools for user interaction.

## Collaboration Levels
- **Level 0**: User observes another manipulating objects.
- **Level 1**: Users manipulate objects individually for a global task.
- **Level 2**: Users interact simultaneously to co-manipulate the same object.

## Guidelines/Advice
- Provide collaboration awareness to users.
- Different interaction methods for co-manipulation.
- Consider weighted objects and lifting capacities for collaboration.
- Rules and constraints for collaborative interactions.
- Implement a way for users to call for help.
